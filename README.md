Welcome to Serge's Tavern!

About -

It is an Elden Ring inspired concept for a restaurant website
Majority of restaurants use 3rd party software to manage their reservations. But Serge’s Tavern uses an internal reservation system.

Technical Challenges -

The biggest technical challenge I faced during production is the passing of props back and forth. Especially when looking for a User that created a reservation as the admin role can see all the reservations submitted. But the users can only see their own upcoming reservations

Lessons Learned -

A lot of mistakes were from me lazily not following the naming conventions.

Every time I thought I created enough routes and components I ended up needing another, and another, and another…

But the biggest mistake came from not taking more time to properly structure the site on paper before jumping into writing code.
